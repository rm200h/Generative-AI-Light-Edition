EULA can be found in model card description or from https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/.

    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches max_new_tokens. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",

    "- This model only supports 'system', 'user' and 'assistant' roles, starting with 'system', then 'user' and alternating (u/a/u/a/u...).\n",
    "- If `max_new_tokens` is not defined, the model may generate up to the maximum total tokens allowed, which is 4K for these models. This may result in endpoint query timeout errors, so it is recommended to set `max_new_tokens` when possible. For 7B, 13B, and 70B models, we recommend to set `max_new_tokens` no greater than 1500, 1000, and 500 respectively, while keeping the total number of tokens less than 4K.\n",
    "- In order to support a 4k context length, this model has restricted query payloads to only utilize a batch size of 1. Payloads with larger batch sizes will receive an endpoint error prior to inference.\n",

      "\n",
      "> Assistant:  Mayonnaise is a thick, creamy condiment made from a mixture of egg yolks, oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and seasonings. Here is a basic recipe for homemade mayonnaise:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 egg yolks\n",
      "* 1/2 cup (120 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vinegar or lemon juice\n",
      "* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and salt until well combined.\n",
      "2. Slowly pour the oil into the egg yolk mixture while continuously whisking. The mixture will begin to thicken and emulsify as you add the oil.\n",
      "3. Once you have added about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of oil, stop whisking and let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes to allow the oil and egg yolks to fully emulsify.\n",
      "4. After the mixture has sat for a few minutes, give it a few quick whisk strokes to check that it has thickened evenly. If it's still a bit too thin, let it sit for a few more minutes and try again.\n",
      "5. Add the vinegar or lemon juice and whisk until fully incorporated.\n",
      "6. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or vinegar to taste.\n",
      "7. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the mayonnaise for at least 30 minutes before using. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the mayonnaise to thicken further.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! This recipe makes about 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) of mayonnaise, which you can use in sandwiches, salads, dips, and other dishes. You can also customize the recipe by adding different seasonings or flavorings, such as garlic, mustard, or hot sauce. Enjoy!\n",

      "> Assistant:  Sure! Here are 10 simple steps to help you build a website:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Define Your Website's Purpose and Goals\n",
      "Before you start building your website, you need to determine its purpose and goals. What do you want your website to achieve? What kind of content will you publish on it? Who is your target audience? Answering these questions will help you create a clear vision for your website and guide your decision-making throughout the building process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Choose a Domain Name and Web Hosting Provider\n",
      "Your domain name is the address of your website (e.g., [www.yoursite.com](http://www.yoursite.com)), while your web hosting provider is the company that will store your website's files and make them accessible to the public. You can choose from a variety of domain name registrars and web hosting providers, but make sure to do your research and choose a reputable one to ensure your website is reliable and secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Plan Your Website's Structure and Navigation\n",
      "The structure and navigation of your website are crucial for user experience and search engine optimization (SEO). Determine the main sections of your website, how they will be organized, and how users will navigate between them. You can create a rough wireframe of your website to help you visualize the structure and make adjustments as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Design Your Website's Layout and Visual Elements\n",
      "The layout and visual elements of your website should be visually appealing and easy to navigate. You can use a website builder or design software like Adobe Dreamweaver or Sketch to create your website's layout, choose a color scheme and fonts, and add images, videos, or other multimedia elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: Write and Optimize Your Website's Content\n",
      "Your website's content should be engaging, informative, and optimized for search engines. Write high-quality, keyword-rich content for your website's pages, and make sure it is well-structured and easy to read. Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up the content and make it more scannable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 6: Add Interactive Elements and Features\n",
      "To make your website more engaging and interactive, you can add features like contact forms, social media integration, and interactive elements like animations\n",

      "\n",
      "> Assistant:  Lemon rice is a popular side dish in many cuisines, particularly in Indian and Middle Eastern cooking. Here is a simple recipe for a delicious lemon rice dish:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 cup uncooked white or brown rice\n",
      "* 2 cups water\n",
      "* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 2-3 lemons)\n",
      "* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "* 1 small onion, finely chopped\n",
      "* 1 small carrot, grated\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "* Salt and pepper, to taste\n",
      "* Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh sieve until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.\n",
      "2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned and translucent, about 5 minutes.\n",
      "3. Add the grated carrot and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "4. Add the rice to the saucepan and stir to coat the rice with the oil and mix with the onion and carrot.\n",
      "5. Pour in the water and lemon juice, and bring the mixture to a boil.\n",
      "6. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked.\n",
      "7. Fluff the rice with a fork and season with salt, pepper, cumin, and coriander.\n",
      "8. Garnish with chopped cilantro, if desired, and serve hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use fresh and high-quality ingredients for the best flavor.\n",
      "* Adjust the amount of lemon juice to your taste. Some people prefer a more acidic taste, while others prefer a milder flavor.\n",
      "* You can also add other ingredients to the rice, such as diced vegetables (e.g., peas, corn), nuts,\n",
